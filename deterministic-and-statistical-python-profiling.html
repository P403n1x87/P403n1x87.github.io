<h1 id="brief-introduction-to-profiling">Brief Introduction to Profiling</h1>
<p>Let's start with a quick introduction to what <em>profiling</em> is. <em>Profiling</em> is a
run-time program analysis technique. Generally, a certain level of
<em>instrumentation</em> is required to retrieve some kind of <em>tracing</em> information
while the program is running. This is usually in the form of tracing
instructions interleaved with the line of your source code, like debug
statements, for instance, usually enriched with timestamp information or other
relevant details, like memory usage, etc... .</p>
<p>One normally distinguishes between two main categories of profilers:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>event-based</em> (or <em>deterministic</em>)</li>
<li><em>statistical</em> (or <em>sampling</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Profilers in the first category make use of <em>hooks</em> that allow registering event
callbacks. At the lowest level, these hooks are provided directly by the
operating system and allow you to trace events like function calls and returns.
Virtual machines and interpreters, like JVM and CPython, provide <em>software</em>
hooks instead, for generally the same events, but also for language-specific
features, like class loading for instance. The reason why profilers in this
category are called <em>deterministic</em> is that, by listening to the various events,
you can get a deterministic view of what is happening inside your application.</p>
<p>In contrast, <em>statistical</em> profilers tend to provide approximate figures only,
obtained by, e.g., sampling the call stack at regular interval of times. These
samples can then be analysed statistically to provide meaningful metrics for the
profiled target.</p>
<p>One might get the impression that deterministic profilers are a better choice
than statistical profilers. However, both categories come with pros and cons.
For example, statistical profilers usually require less instrumentation, if none
at all, and introduce less overhead in the profiled target program. Therefore,
if a statistical profiler can guarantee a certain accuracy on the metrics that
can be derived from them, then it is usually a better choice over a more
accurate deterministic profiler that can introduce higher overhead.</p>
<h1 id="python-profiling">Python Profiling</h1>
<p>There are quite a plethora of profiling tools available for Python, either
deterministic or statistical. The official documentation describes the use of
the Python profiling interface through two different implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-profile"><code>profile</code></a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile"><code>cProfile</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The former is a pure Python module and, as such, introduces more overhead than
the latter, which is a C extension that implements the same interface as
<code>profile</code>. They both fit into the category of <em>deterministic</em> profilers and make
use of the Python C API
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#profiling-and-tracing"><code>PyEval_SetProfile</code></a>
to register event hooks.</p>
<h2 id="standard-python-profiling">Standard Python Profiling</h2>
<p>Let's have a look at how to use <code>cProfile</code>, as this will be the standard choice
for a deterministic profiler. Here is an example that will profile the
call-stack of <code>psutil.process_iter</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># File: process_iter.py</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">cProfile</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">psutil</span>

<span class="n">cProfile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="s1">&#39;[list(psutil.process_iter()) for i in range(1_000)]&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">&#39;process_iter&#39;</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The above code runs <code>psutil.process_iter</code> for 1000 times through cProfile and
sends the output to the <code>process_iter</code> file in the current working directory. A
good reason to save the result to a file is that one can then use a tool like
<a href="https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot">gprof2dot</a> to provide a graphical
representation of the collected data. This tool turns the output of cProfile
into a dot graph which can then be visualised to make better sense of it. E.g.,
these are the commands required to collect the data and visualise it in the form
of a DOT graph inside a PDF document:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python3 process_iter.py
gprof2dot -f pstats process_iter <span class="p">|</span> dot -Tpdf -o process_iter.pdf
</pre></div>


<p>This is what the result will look like. The colours help us identify the
branches of execution where most of the time is spent.</p>
<p><img alt="process_iter" src="./images/python-profiling/process_iter.svg"></p>
<h2 id="a-look-under-the-bonnet">A Look Under the Bonnet</h2>
<p>The output of a tool like gprof2dot can be quite intuitive to understand,
especially if you have had some prior experience with profilers. However, in
order to better appreciate what is still to come it is best if we have a quick
look at some of the basics of the Python execution model.</p>
<p>Python is an interpreted language and the reference implementation of its
interpreter is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython">CPython</a>. As the name
suggests, it is written in C, and it offers a C API that can be used to write C
extensions.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental objects of CPython is the interpreter itself, which has a
data structure associated with it, namely <code>PyInterpreterState</code>. In principle,
there can be many instances of <code>PyInterpreterState</code> within the same process, but
for the sake of simplicity, we shall ignore this possibility here. One of the
fields of this C data structure is <code>tstate_head</code>, which points to the first
element of a doubly-linked list of instances of the <code>PyThreadState</code> structure.
As you can imagine, this other data structure represents the state of a thread
of execution associated with the referring interpreter instance. We can navigate
this list by following the references of its field <code>next</code> (and navigate back
with <code>prev</code>).</p>
<p>Each instance of <code>PyThreadState</code> points to the current execution frame, which is
the object that bears the information about the execution of a code block via
the field <code>frame</code>. This is described by the <code>PyFrameObject</code> structure, which is
also a list. In fact, this is the stack that we are after. Each frame will have,
in general, a parent frame that can be retrieved by means of the <code>f_back</code>
pointer on the <code>PyFrameObject</code> structure. The picture produced by gprof2dot of
the previous section is the graphical representation of this stack of frames.
The information contained in the first row of each box comes from the
<code>PyCodeObject</code> structure, which can be obtained from every instance of
<code>PyFrameObject</code> via the <code>f_code</code> field. In particular, <code>PyCodeObject</code> allows you
to retrieve the name of the file that contains the Python code being executed in
that frame as well as its line number and the name of the context (e.g. the
current function).</p>
<p>Sometimes the C API changes between releases, but the following image is a
fairly stable representation of the relations between the above-mentioned
structures that are common among many of the major CPython releases.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/python-profiling/python_structs.svg"
    alt="CPython data structures"
  />
</p>

<p>The loop around <code>PyFrameObject</code>, which represents its field <code>f_back</code>, creates
the structure of a singly-linked list of frame objects. This is precisely the
frame stack.</p>
<p>The Python profiling API can be demonstrated with some simple Python code. The
following example declares a decorator, <code>@profile</code>, that can be used to extract
the frame stack generated by the execution of a function. In this case, we
define the factorial function</p>

<h2 id="statistical-profiling">Statistical Profiling</h2>
<p>For a profiler from the statistical category, we have to look for external
tools. In this case, The "standard" approach is to make use of a system call
like <code>setitimer</code>, which is used to register a signal handler that gets called at
regular intervals of time. The general idea is to register a callback that gets
a snapshot of the current frame stack when triggered. An example of a profiler
that works like this is <a href="https://github.com/vmprof/vmprof-python">vmprof</a>.</p>
<p>Some drawbacks of this approach are: 1. the signal handler runs in the same
process as the Python interpreter, and generally the main thread; 2. signals can
interrupt system calls, which can cause stalls in the running program.</p>
<p>There are other approaches that can be taken in order to implement a statistical
profiler, though. An example is <a href="https://github.com/uber/pyflame">pyflame</a>,
which is more in the spirit of a debugging tool and uses <code>ptrace</code>-like system
calls. The situation is a bit more involved here since the profiler is now an
external process. The general idea is to use <code>ptrace</code> to pause the running
Python program, read its virtual memory and reconstruct the frame stack from it.
Here, the main challenges are 1. to find the location of the relevant CPython
data structures in memory and 2. parse them to extract the frame stack
information. The differences between Python 2 and Python 3 and the occasional
changes of the CPython ABI within the same minor release add up to the
complexity of the task.</p>
<p>Once all has been taken care of, though, a statistical profiler of this kind has
the potential of lowering the overhead caused by source instrumentation even
further so that the payoff is generally worth the effort.</p>
<h1 id="enter-austin">Enter Austin</h1>
<p>We just saw that with a tool like pyflame we can get away with no
instrumentation. An objection that can be raised against it, though, is that it
still halts the profiled program in order to read the interpreter state. System
calls like <code>ptrace</code> were designed for debugging tools, for which it is desirable
to stop the execution at some point, inspect memory, step over one instruction
or a whole line of source code at a time etc.... Ideally, we would like our
profiler to interfere as little as possible with the profiled program.</p>
<p>This is where a tool like <a href="https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin">Austin</a> comes
into play. Austin is, strictly speaking, not a full-fledged profiler on its own.
In fact, Austin is merely a frame stack sampler for CPython. Concretely, this
means that all Austin does is to sample the frame stack of a running Python
program at (almost) regular intervals of time.</p>
<p>A similar approach is followed by <a href="https://github.com/benfred/py-spy">py-spy</a>,
another Python profiler written in Rust and inspired by
<a href="https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy">rbspy</a>. However, Austin tends to provide higher
performance in general for two main reasons. One is that it is written in pure
C, with no external dependencies other than the standard C library. The other is
that Austin is just a frame stack sampler. It focuses on dumping the relevant
parts of the Python interpreter state as quickly as possible and delegates any
data aggregations and analysis to external tools. In theory, Austin offers you
higher sampling rates at virtually no cost at the expenses of the profiled
process. This makes Austin the ideal choice for profiling production code at
run-time, with not even a single line of instrumentation required!</p>
<p>So, how does Austin read the virtual memory of another process without halting
it? Many platforms offer system calls to do just that. On Linux, for example,
the system call is
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_vm_readv.2.html"><code>process_vm_readv</code></a>.
Once one has located the instance of <code>PyInterpreterState</code>, everything else
follows automatically, as we saw with the discussion on some of the details of
the CPython execution model.</p>
<h2 id="on-your-marks">On Your Marks</h2>
<p>At this point you might have started, quite understandably, to be a bit
concerned with concurrency issues. What can we actually make of a memory dump
from a running process we have no control over? What guarantees do we have that
the moment we decide to peek at the Python interpreter state, we find all the
relevant data structures in a consistent state? The answer to this question lies
in the difference in execution speed between C and Python code, the latter
being, on average, order of 10 times faster than the former. So what we have
here is a race between Austin (which is written in C) and the Python target.
When Austin samples the Python interpreter memory, it does so quite quickly
compared to the scale of execution of a Python code block. On the other hand,
CPython is also written in C, can refresh its state pretty quickly too. As a
cinematic analogy, think that we are trying to create an animation by taking
snapshots of a moving subject in quick succession. If the motion we are trying
to capture is not too abrupt (compared to the time it takes to take a snapshot,
that is), then we won't spot any motion blur and our images will be perfectly
clear. This video of the Cassini flyby over Jupiter, Europa and Io, for
instance, been made from still images, visualises this idea clearly.</p>
<p align="center">
  <iframe
      class="center-image"
    width="100%"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0JxkZjwpRg"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</p>

<p>With Austin, each frame stack sample is the analogue of a snapshot and the
moving subject is the Python code being executed by the interpreter. Of course,
Austin could be unlucky and decide to sample precisely during the moment CPython
is in the middle of updating the frame stack. However, based on our previous
considerations, we can expect this to be a rather rare event. Sometimes a
picture is worth a thousand words, so here is an idealistic "CPython vs Austin"
execution timeline comparison.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/python-profiling/timeline.svg"
    alt="CPython and Austin timeline comparison"
  />
</p>

<p>Now one could argue that, in order to decrease the error rate, an approach
similar to pyflame, where we halt the execution before taking a snapshot, would
be a better solution. In fact, it makes practically no difference. Indeed it
could happen that the profiler decides to call <code>ptrace</code> while CPython is in the
middle of refreshing the frame stack. In this case, it doesn't really matter
whether CPython has been halted or not, the frame stack will be in an
inconsistent state anyway.</p>
<p>As a final wrap-up comment to this digression, statistical profilers for Python
like Austin can produce reliable output, as the error rate tends to be very low.
This is possible because Austin is written in pure C and therefore offers
optimal sampling performance.</p>
<h2 id="flame-graphs-with-austin">Flame Graphs with Austin</h2>
<p>The simplest way to turn Austin into a basic profiler is to pipe it to a tool
like Brendan Gregg's <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph">FlameGraph</a>.
For example, assuming that <code>austin</code> is in your <code>PATH</code> variable (e.g. because you
have installed it from the Snap Store with <code>sudo snap install austin --beta
--classic</code>) and that <code>flamegraph.pl</code> is installed in <code>/opt/flamegraph</code>, we can
do</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>austin python3 process_iter.py <span class="p">|</span> /opt/flamegraph/flamegraph.pl --countname<span class="o">=</span>usec &gt; process_iter.svg
</pre></div>


<p>We are using <code>--countname=usec</code> because Austin samples frame stacks in
microseconds and this information will then be part of the output of the flame
graph tool. The following image is the result that I have got from running the
above command.</p>
<p><object data="./images/python-profiling/process_iter_fg.svg"
          type="image/svg+xml"
                width="100%"
                class="center-image" >
  <img src="./images/python-profiling/process_iter_fg.svg" style="width:100%;"/>
</object></p>
<p>Austin is now included in the official Debian repositories. This means that you
can install it with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>apt install austin
</pre></div>


<p>on Linux distributions that are derived from Debian. On Windows, Austin can be
installed from <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/austin">Chocolatey</a> with the
command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>choco install austin --pre
</pre></div>


<p>Alternatively, you can just head to the
<a href="https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin/releases">release</a> page on GitHub and
download the appropriate binary release for your platform.</p>
<h2 id="the-tui">The TUI</h2>
<p>The GitHub repository of Austin comes with a TUI application written in Python
and based on <code>curses</code>. It provides an example of an application that uses the
output from Austin to display <em>live</em> top-like profiling statistics of a running
Python program.</p>
<p>If you want to try it, you can install it with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install git+https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin.git
</pre></div>


<p>and run it with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>austin-tui python3 /path/to/process_iter.py
</pre></div>


<p>By default, the TUI shows only the current frame being executed in the selected
thread. You can navigate through the different threads with <kbd>⇞ Page Up</kbd>
and <kbd>⇟ Page Down</kbd>. You can also view all the collected samples with the
Full Mode, which can be toggled with <kbd>F</kbd>. The currently executing frame
will be highlighted and a tree representation of the current frame stack will be
available on the right-hand side of the terminal.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/python-profiling/austin-tui_threads_nav.gif"
    alt="Austin TUI"
  />
</p>

<p>If you are a statistician or a data scientist working with Python, you can use
the TUI to peek at your model while it is training to see what is going on and
to identify areas of your code that could potentially be optimised to run
faster. For example, let's assume that you are training a model on Linux in a
single process using the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python3 my_model.py
</pre></div>


<p>You can attach the TUI to your model with the command (as superuser)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>austin-tui -p <span class="sb">`</span>pgrep -f my_model.py <span class="p">|</span> head -n <span class="m">1</span><span class="sb">`</span> -i <span class="m">10000</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>pgrep</code> part is there to select the PID of the Python process that is
running your model, while <code>-i 10000</code> sets the sampling interval to 10 ms.</p>
<h2 id="web-austin">Web Austin</h2>
<p>Web Austin is another example of how to use Austin to build a profiling tool. In
this case, we make use of the
<a href="https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph">d3-flame-graph</a> plugin for
<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> to produce a <strong>live</strong> flame graph visualisation of the
collected samples inside a web browser. This opens up to <em>remote profiling</em>, as
the web application can be served on an arbitrary IPv4 address.</p>
<p>Like the TUI, Web Austin can be installed from GitHub with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install git+https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin.git
</pre></div>


<p>Assuming you are still interested to see what is happening inside your
statistical model while it is training, you can use the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>austin-web -p <span class="sb">`</span>pgrep -f my-model.py <span class="p">|</span> head -n <span class="m">1</span><span class="sb">`</span> -i <span class="m">10000</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As for the TUI, the command line arguments are the same as Austin's. When Web
Austin starts up, it creates a simple HTTP server that serves on <code>localhost</code> at
an ephemeral port.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># austin-web -p `pgrep -f my-model.py | head -n 1` -i 10000
_____      ___       __    ______       _______              __________             _____
____/|_    __ |     / /_______  /_      ___    |___  __________  /___(_)______      ____/|_
_|    /    __ | /| / /_  _ \_  __ \     __  /| |  / / /_  ___/  __/_  /__  __ \     _|    /

* Sampling process with PID 3711 (python3 my_model.py)
* Web Austin is running on http://localhost:34257. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
</pre></div>


<p>If you then open <code>http://localhost:34257</code> in your browser you will then see a
web application that looks like the following</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/python-profiling/web-austin.gif"
    alt="Web Austin"
  />
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that an active internet connection is required for the application to
work, as the d3-flame-graph plugin, as well as some fonts, are retrieved from
remote sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to change the host and the port of the HTTP server created by Web
Austin you can set the environment variables <code>WEBAUSTIN_HOST</code> and
<code>WEBAUSTIN_PORT</code>. If you want to run the Web Austin web application on, e.g.,
<code>0.0.0.0:8080</code>, so that it can be accessed from everywhere, use the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># WEBAUSTIN_HOST=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot; WEBAUSTIN_PORT=8080 austin-web -p `pgrep -f my-model.py | head -n 1` -i 10000

* Sampling process with PID 3711 (python3 my_model.py)
* Web Austin is running on http://0.0.0.0:8080. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

<h2 id="write-your-own">Write Your Own</h2>
<p>Austin's Powers (!) reside in its very simplicity. The "hard" problem of
sampling the Python frame stack has been solved for you so that you can focus on
processing the samples to produce the required metrics.</p>
<p>If you decide to write a tool in Python, the Austin project on GitHub comes with
a Python wrapper. Depending on your preferences, you can choose between a
thread-based approach or an <code>asyncio</code> one. Just as an example, let's see how to
use the <code>AsyncAustin</code> class to make a custom profiler based on the samples
collected by Austin.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">austin</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">AsyncAustin</span>

    <span class="c1"># Subclass AsyncAustin and implement this callback. This will be called</span>
    <span class="c1"># every time Austin generates a sample. The convenience method parse_line</span>
    <span class="c1"># will parse the sample and produce the thread name, the stack of contexts</span>
    <span class="c1"># with the corresponding line numbers and the measured duration for the</span>
    <span class="c1"># sample.</span>

        <span class="n">my_austin</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;The profiled target has terminated.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">KeyboardInterrupt</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;MyAustin has been terminated from keyboard.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As the example above shows, it is enough to inherit from <code>AsyncAustin</code> and
define the <code>on_sample_received</code> callback. This will get called every time Austin
produces a sample. You can then do whatever you like with it. Here we simply
pass the <code>sample</code>, which is just a binary string in the format <code>Thread
[tid];[func] ([mod]);#[line no];[func] ...;L[line no] [usec]</code> to the
<code>parse_line</code> function, which conveniently split the string into its main
components, i.e. the thread identifier, the stack of frames and the sample
duration. We then print the resulting triple to screen.</p>
<p>The rest of the code is there to create an instance of this custom Austin
application. We call <code>wait</code> to ensure that Austin has been started successfully.
The optional argument is a timeout, which defaults to 1. If Austin is not
started within 1 second, <code>wait</code> returns <code>False</code>. If we do not wish to do
anything else with the event loop, we can then simply call the <code>join</code> methods
which schedules the main read loop that calls the <code>on_sample_received</code> callback
whenever a sample is read from Austin's <code>stdout</code> file descriptor.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>In this post, we have seen a few profiling options for Python. We have argued
that some statistical profilers, like Austin, can prove valuable tools. Whilst
providing approximate figures, the accuracy is in general quite high and the
error rate very low. Furthermore, no instrumentation is required and the
overhead introduced is very minimal, all aspects that make a tool like Austin a
perfect choice for many Python profiling needs.</p>
<p>A feature that distinguishes Austin from the rest is its extreme simplicity
which implies great flexibility. By just sampling the frame stack of the Python
interpreter, the user is left with the option of using the collected samples to
derive the metrics that best suit the problem at hand.</p>
