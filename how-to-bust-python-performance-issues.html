    <p>In this short post I will try to convince you of how easy it is to find performance issues in your Python code and how you should develop the habit of profiling your code before you ship it.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In my experience as a software engineer, I think it's still way to common to see
production-ready code being shipped without having been profiled at least once.
With the current computing power and the ever increasing number of available
cores per machine, it feels like a lot of preference is generally given to
readable and maintainable code at the cost of those extra microseconds. Whilst
this might make sense for extremely complex code-bases in low-level languages,
this is perhaps more of an issue with technologies like Python, where in general
you can still make some substantial optimisations while still retaining
readability and maintainability.</p>
<p>To further prove to myself that profiling is still an important step in the
development process that gets overlooked, I did the following experiment. I
grabbed a Python project at random, the first one that popped up on my GitHub
feed, looked at its test suite and profiled the test runs. The day I did this,
<a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a> was sitting at the top of my GitHub
feed, so what follows is a trace-back of the steps that led me to contribute
<a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/1253">this performance PR</a> to the
project. Besides Python, the other tools that I have used are <a href="https://github.com/p403n1x87/austin">Austin
3</a> and VS Code with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=p403n1x87.austin-vscode">Austin
extension</a>
installed.</p>
<p>So first of all, let's make sure that our test environment is fully set up. If
you want to follow along, make sure that you have Austin and VS Code installed.
I was using Windows the day I made this experiment, so I had Austin installed
with <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/austin/">choco</a>, and the VS Code
extension installed from the Visual Studio Marketplace. Let's get our hands on
some code now by cloning Rich and checking out that commit that was master for
me at that time. Open up a terminal and type</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich.git
git checkout ce4f18c
</pre></div>


<p>The project uses <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">poetry</a> so running
the test suite is as easy as invoking</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>poetry install
poetry run python -m pytest
</pre></div>


<p>Once we are sure that all the tests pass we are ready to start getting some
profiling data to see what's actually running. Version 3 of Austin comes with a
reworked <code>sleepless</code> mode that can be used to get an estimate of CPU time
instead of wall time. One big advantage of using a tool like Austin is that we
do not have to make any changes to the code in order to get profiling data out
of it. Besides, Austin runs out-of-process, which means that it won't have any
effects on the code. Getting profiling data is as easy as invoking Austin just
before the test run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>poetry run austin -so profile_master.austin python -m pytest -vv tests
</pre></div>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> Here we can let Austin sample the whole <code>pytest</code> run because we
have checked beforehand that it only takes a few seconds to complete. <strong>DO
NOT</strong> try the same exact thing with long-running test suites or you would end
up with a massive sample file that would be hard to process. In such cases you
can either select a few tests, or run Austin with the <code>-x,--exposure</code> option
to limit sampling to just a few seconds, and adjust the sampling interval with
the <code>-i\--interval</code> option as best suited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>-s</code> option turns the <code>sleepless</code> mode on, which gives us only the on-CPU
samples, whereas the <code>-o</code> option specifies the output file. Once the test run
terminates, our profiling data will be in <code>profile_master.austin</code>, ready to be
analysed with the Austin VS Code extension. We get the best experience if we
start VS Code from within the project's root directory as this allows us to
browse the code while we look at the flame graph. So fire up VS Code from the
terminal with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>code .
</pre></div>


<p>and activate the Austin extension by clicking on the <code>FLAME GRAPH</code> tab in the
bottom panel. Sometimes you would have to right click inside the panel and click
the menu entry to fully activate the extension.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/bust-perf-issues/austin-panel.png"
    alt="The Austin Flame Graph panel within VS Code"
  />
</p>

<p>At this point we are ready to load the profiling data that we have collected.
Click on the <code>OPEN</code> button or press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> +
<kbd>A</kbd> to bring up the open dialog and select <code>profile_master.austin</code>. The
Austin VS Code extension will analyse all the collected sample and generate the
flame graph.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/bust-perf-issues/open-profile.gif"
    alt="Open a profile file"
  />
</p>

<p>The picture we get is certainly overwhelming at first, especially for those that
are not familiar with how <code>pytest</code> works internally. This is perhaps a nice way
to actually find out how <code>pytest</code> collects and run tests. By poking around we
discover that some of the test runs are under the <code>pytest_pyfunc_call</code> frame. If
you are struggling to find it, press <kbd>F</kbd> inside the flame graph to
reveal the search input box, type <code>pytest_pyfunc_call</code> and hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.
The frames that match the search string will be highlighted in purple. Let's
scroll until we find the largest one. When we click on it, it will expand to the
full width of the panel to give us a better idea of what lies underneath it, and
the corresponding portion of the source code will also appear in VS Code!</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/bust-perf-issues/pytest_pyfunc_call.gif"
    alt="pytest_pyfunc_call"
  />
</p>

<p>We now have a better view of the tests that are being executed under this path.
At this point we can start looking for the largest leaf frames and see if we can
make any sense of them. When I first looked at this graph, one thing that
quickly caught my eye was this particular stack.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/bust-perf-issues/test_log.png"
    alt="test_log"
  />
</p>

<p>Clicking on the <code>test_log</code> frame reveals the test code in VS Code. Surprisingly,
the test has just a single call to <code>Console.log</code>, and the percent timing
annotation generated by the Austin extension tell us that, of the whole on-CPU
time for the test suite, about 4.9% is spent on that single call!</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/bust-perf-issues/test_log_code.png"
    alt="The code for the test_log test case"
  />
</p>

<p>Looking back at the flame graph, we realise that all the time in the <code>log</code> frame
is spent calling <code>stack</code>. Clicking on the <code>log</code> frame reveals the source code
for the <code>Console.log</code> method and we can inspect how the information from the
stack is used to generate the log entry. The line we are interested in is 1685,
where we have</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>            <span class="n">caller</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">inspect</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stack</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="n">_stack_offset</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So <code>inspect.stack()</code> is called, which according to the flame graph does a lot of
resolutions for each frame (see those calls to <code>findsource</code>, <code>getmodule</code>
etc...), none of which seems to be used in <code>Console.log</code>, and besides we just
pick one of the frames close to the top of the stack and chuck the rest away.
That's pretty expensive for a simple log call. Since I had some familiarity with
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html"><code>inspect</code></a> module with my
work on Austin and other stuff, I knew there is (at least for CPython) the lower
level method
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.currentframe"><code>currentframe</code></a>
that would give you essential information about the currently executing frame.
From there you can navigate down the stack and stop at the frame of interest. In
this case we just need to take the parent frame of the current one, and we
already find all the information needed by the <code>Console.log</code> method. I made the
changes as part of the already mentioned PR
<a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/1253">#1253</a>, so if you check that
code out and re-run the tests with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>poetry run austin -so profile_pr.austin python -m pytest -vv tests
</pre></div>


<p>and open the new profiling data in <code>profile_pr.austin</code> you will see that the
test case <code>test_log</code> has pretty much disappeared as it basically takes almost
zero CPU time now.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./images/bust-perf-issues/test_log_pr.png"
    alt="test_log with the performance change"
  />
</p>

<p>Instead we see <code>test_log_caller_frame_info</code>, which is the test case for the
compatibility utility for those Python implementations that do not implement
<code>currentframe</code>. But with CPython, calling <code>Console.log</code> is now inexpensive
compared to the original implementation.</p>
<p>See how easy it's been to find a performance issue. With the right tool we
didn't have to add any instrumentation to the code, especially in one we
probably had no familiarity with. In many cases you only understand your code
truly if you see it in action. So no more excuses for not profiling your code
before you ship it! ;P</p>
